**Total Spend 2024:** USD 2,045,000

## ORIGINAL SPEND CONCENTRATION (2024)

| Country | % of Total Spend | Cost (USD) |
|---------|------------------|------------|
| Malaysia | 100% | 2,045,000 |
| Other Regions | 0% | 0 |
| **Total SEA Concentration** | **100%** | **2,045,000** |

Malaysia and Other Regions each exceeded 40% of spend, creating high regional dependency.

## DIVERSIFIED TARGET STATE (NEW SPLIT)

|------------------|------------------|----------------|--------------------|
| Malaysia | 25% | 511,250 | 75% lower |
| India | 20% | 409,000 | New addition |
| Spain | 20% | 409,000 | New addition |
| USA | 15% | 306,750 | New addition |
| Thailand | 15% | 306,750 | New addition |
| China | 5% | 102,250 | New addition |
| **Total** | **100%** | **2,045,000** | **Balanced cost + risk mix** |

## REDUCTION IN SPEND SHARE

| Country | Reduction in Spend Share |
|---------|--------------------------|
| Malaysia | 100% → 25% = 75.0% reduction in share |

## REGIONAL DEPENDENCY IMPROVEMENT

| Metric | Original 2024 | New Target | Reduction |
|--------|---------------|------------|-----------|
| SEA Regional Dependency | 100% | 58–63% | 27–32% reduction |

## REGIONAL COST ADVANTAGE DRIVERS

| Region | Cost Benefit Driver | Estimated Annual Advantage (USD) |
|--------|---------------------|----------------------------------|
| India | 20–30% lower rice-bran input cost + scaling extraction capacity | 40,000 – 65,000 |
| Thailand | 8–12% lower landed cost due to strong milling ecosystem + efficient ports | 12,000 – 28,000 |
| China | 12–18% lower industrial extraction pricing due to processing scale | 18,000 – 35,000 |
| Blended Annual Advantage | Supplier competition + cheaper inputs + resilient logistics routing | 70,000 – 128,000 |

## STRATEGIC OUTCOME

- Reduce Malaysia and Other Regions reliance by 16% each
- Add 5 new extraction ecosystems to offset cost
- Increase supplier pricing competition
- Improve logistics routing resilience
- Reduce corridor risk by ~30% with blended cost advantage

## NEXT STEPS

- Shortlist suppliers in India, Spain, USA, Thailand, China
- Initiate 8–12 week pilot contracts
- Review pricing and delivery performance quarterly
- Reduce concentration further if pilots outperform
