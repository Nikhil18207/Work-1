# LEADERSHIP BRIEF – RICE BRAN OIL DIVERSIFICATION

**Assumed Total Category Spend 2024:** USD 2,045,000

## CURRENT STATE – SUPPLIER CONCENTRATION RISK

| Metric | 2024 Original |
|--------|---------------|
| Supplier | Malaya Agri Oils |
| Supplier Location | APAC |
| Spend Share | 65% = USD 1,335,000 |
| Current Rice Bran Oil Buying from Supplier | Yes |
| Alternate Supplier for Rice Bran Oil | Mediterranean Oils |
| Key Risk | High supplier concentration (65%) and APAC supply corridor dependency |

## OVERALL RISK STATEMENT

Our current rice bran oil procurement involves 2 suppliers, with Malaya Agri Oils as the dominant supplier at 65% of total category spend (USD 1,335,000 of USD 2,045,000 in 2024). Other suppliers include: Borneo Nutrients (35%). All suppliers operate from APAC. We currently do not source rice bran oil from Mediterranean Oils, an already approved Edible Oils supplier in our system with operational presence across Spain, Ukraine, USA, Indonesia. 

This creates both a high supplier concentration risk and a correlated geographic concentration risk. It is recommended to activate rice bran oil with Mediterranean Oils to offset this dependency, introduce price competition, diversify geographic exposure, and enable alternate logistics routing, while continuing optimization and quarterly rebalancing.

## SUPPLIER SHARE REDUCTION IMPACT (TARGET STATE)

| Supplier | Original Share | New Target Cap | Reduction in Concentration |
|----------|----------------|----------------|----------------------------|
| Malaya Agri Oils | 65% | 62% | 3% reduction |
| Mediterranean Oils | 0% | 38% | Enables supplier competition + fallback |

## REGIONAL DEPENDENCY IMPROVEMENT

| Metric | Original 2024 | New Target | Net Reduction |
|--------|---------------|------------|---------------|
| Southeast Asia Supply Corridor | 100% | 58–63% | 27–32% reduction |

## COST ADVANTAGE PROJECTION FROM ADDING ALTERNATE SUPPLIER

| Region | Advantage Driver | Estimated Annual Cost Benefit (USD) |
|--------|------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Indonesia | Port efficiency + strong milling ecosystem | 12,000 – 28,000 |
| Blended Advantage | Supplier competition + input cost reduction + logistics resilience | 12,000 – 28,000 |

## STRATEGIC OUTCOME

- Reduce single-supplier concentration from 65% to 62% in Phase 1
- Activate 38% of spend via an incumbent supplier with multi-region presence
- Improve pricing leverage through supplier competition
- Reduce regional logistics corridor risk by ~30%
- Achieve an estimated blended annual cost advantage of USD 24,000–56,000 while improving supply continuity resilience

## NEXT STEPS

- Activate Rice Bran Oil with Mediterranean Oils
- Initiate 8–12 week pilot allocations
- Benchmark pricing and delivery quarterly
- Continue phased reduction based on pilot performance
