## 9. ESCALATION AND EXCEPTION HANDLING

### 9.1 Data Insufficiency Protocol

**IF data is insufficient for decision:**

**Step 1: Identify Gaps**
- Document missing data points
- Assess criticality (HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW)
- Estimate time to obtain data

**Step 2: Risk Assessment**
- Evaluate decision risk without complete data
- Consider business urgency
- Assess cost of delay vs. risk of wrong decision

**Step 3: Decision Path**

**Option A: Delay Decision (Preferred)**
- If risk is HIGH and time permits
- Request missing data from supplier/stakeholders
- Set deadline for data submission (typically 5-10 business days)
- Re-evaluate when data complete

**Option B: Conditional Approval**
- If business urgency is HIGH
- Approve with conditions (e.g., "pending ESG audit")
- Set milestones for data completion
- Include exit clauses if conditions not met

**Option C: Escalate**
- If data cannot be obtained and decision is critical
- Escalate to next approval level with risk documentation
- Senior management decides with explicit risk acknowledgment

**Questions to Ask When Data is Insufficient:**

1. **What specific data is missing?**
   - Financial statements?
   - Quality certifications?
   - ESG scores?
   - Market benchmarks?
   - Performance history?

2. **Why is this data missing?**
   - New supplier (no history)?
   - Supplier non-responsive?
   - Data doesn't exist (e.g., new market)?
   - Confidentiality concerns?

3. **Can we obtain this data?**
   - From supplier directly?
   - From third-party sources?
   - From industry databases?
   - From peer companies?

4. **What is the impact of deciding without this data?**
   - Financial risk: $X exposure
   - Quality risk: Potential defects/recalls
   - Compliance risk: Regulatory violations
   - Reputational risk: ESG concerns

5. **What is the cost of delay?**
   - Lost sales/revenue?
   - Production downtime?
   - Competitive disadvantage?
   - Contractual penalties?

6. **Are there alternative suppliers with complete data?**
   - Can we source from better-documented suppliers?
   - What is the cost/time difference?
