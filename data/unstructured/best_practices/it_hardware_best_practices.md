# IT Hardware & Technology Procurement - Best Practices

## Overview
This document outlines industry best practices for IT hardware procurement based on global standards and successful implementations.

## 1. Strategic Planning

### 1.1 Technology Roadmap Alignment
- **Align with Business Strategy**: Ensure IT hardware purchases support 3-5 year business objectives
- **Refresh Cycles**: Plan laptop refreshes every 3-4 years, servers every 5-7 years
- **Standardization**: Limit to 2-3 approved brands per category to reduce complexity
- **Future-Proofing**: Consider emerging technologies (AI, edge computing) in specifications

### 1.2 Total Cost of Ownership (TCO)
- **Purchase Price**: Only 30-40% of total cost
- **Maintenance**: 20-25% over lifecycle
- **Energy Costs**: 15-20% for servers and data center equipment
- **Support & Training**: 10-15%
- **Disposal**: 5-10%

**Best Practice**: Use TCO calculators for purchases >$50,000

## 2. Supplier Selection
